# Aidan Flinn's Webpage!

### A little about me!
My name is Aidan Flinn and I am in my sophomore year at Boise State University! I am currently majoring in computer science. I am originally from Lake Stevens, Washington which is a medium sized town of about 30,000 residents about 45 minutes north of Seattle. In my free time I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, and exercising. Thanks for reading!
